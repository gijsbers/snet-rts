This documents the communication protocol between the resource server
and the connecting clients.

Each protocol message is surrounded by a left and right brace: { ... }

After the left brace starts the message type (request or reply): { type ... }
Each message type is a single name in lowercase alphabetical letters.
______________________________________________________________________________

Clients can issue the following message types (here enclosed in double quotes)
with the given accompanying parameters:

"list"

Requests a space separated list of a computer system identification numbers
for the currently managed set of systems, where id zero always represents
the local computer system.

"topology" id

Requests a complete hardware topology description of the node/cache/core
hierarchy of the system which is identified by number 'id'.

"access" idlist

Communicates to the server that the client can access and make use of
the computer resources for all systems in the given space separated
list of system identification number.

"local" workload

Here workload is a number which represents an estimate for the approximate
number of processor cores which could be used to process the local workload.

"remote" workload

Here workload is a number which represents an estimate for the approximate
number of processor cores which could be used to non-locally process workload.

"accept" id cores

This is a response to a server "grant" message which acknowledges to the server
that the client will be using the cores on computer system 'id'. The cores are
identified by the space separated list of logical core numbers.

"return" id cores

This communicates to the server a list of logical processor core numbers
which the client is no longer using on the system identified by 'id'.
The list is a space separated list of logical core numbers.
______________________________________________________________________________

Servers can issue the following message types (here enclosed in double quotes)
with the given accompanying parameters:

"systems" idlist

Gives a space separated list of machine identification numbers for the
currently managed set of computer systems. Zero is used to represent
the local computer system.

"grant" id cores

This gives the receiving client a license to use the given processor cores
on the computer system identified by 'id' to process the client workload.
The list is a space separated list of logical core numbers. A client should
identicate about each core whether it is going to use it (with an "accept"
message) or not (with a "return" message).

"revoke" id cores

This requests to the client the stop using the given list of logical
processor core numbers. The client should acknowledge this request with
one or more "return" responses.
